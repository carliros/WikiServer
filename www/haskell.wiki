== Haskell 

From Haskell Wiki - [[ http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/bin/view/USCS2010 | USCS 2010]]

Haskell is an advanced [[http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Functional_programming |  purely functional programming ]] language. An open source product of 
more than twenty years of cutting edge research, it allows rapid development of robust, concise, correct software. With strong support for 
[[http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/haskell/ffi | integration with other languages]], built-in
[[http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Applications_and_libraries/Concurrency_and_parallelism | concurrency and parallelism]], debuggers, profilers, 
rich libraries and an active community, Haskell makes it easier to produce flexible, maintainable high-quality software.
